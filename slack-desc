qhull: Qhull (calculate convex hulls and related structures)
qhull:
qhull: Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi
qhull: diagram, halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site
qhull: Delaunay triangulation, and furthest-site Voronoi diagram.  It runs
qhull: in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.  It implements the Quickhull
qhull: algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull handles roundoff
qhull: errors from floating point arithmetic.  It can approximate a convex
qhull: hull.
